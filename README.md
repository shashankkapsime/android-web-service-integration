This will show a sample to how to use HttpUrlConnection to use rest APIs.

We are using Gson library provided by google to parse to Json data coming as a response and sending json request to server.

In this example we have used Google Geocoder Webservice API to integrate the rest API.
URL = "http://maps.google.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=28.525354,77.284634";
